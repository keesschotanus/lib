# Lib

This is my library project that I use to collect standard functions, I use a lot in Java projects.
It is a resurrection of [jxpfw](https://jxpfw.sourceforge.net/) which is no longer maintained.

JDK 17 is used for this library, allowing me to use records, generics, optionals
and all this new stuff that simply was not available when I wrote the first implementation
in the previous millennium. 

This library is currently, almost empty, but new classes will be added in the future.

Instead of using this library as a maven dependency,
feel free to copy/paste anything you like.

## Build
```mvn clean install jacoco:report```
